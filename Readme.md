##  Reinforcement learning & dynamic programming algos

 
This repo contains several jupyter notebooks that implements some RL/DP algos with OpenAI Gym games.

It also serves as my notes for Lehigh ISE416 dynamic programming.

* DP
    * Value iteration
    * Policy iteration
    * Approximation
* TD
    * Q-learning
    * SARSA
